👋 Hi, I’m @noportman

I'm a passionate geospatial data enthusiast with a deep interest in water resources and sustainability data analysis. As a ClimateBase Fellow, I'm dedicated to leveraging data-driven insights and technology to address pressing environmental challenges. 🌍💧

With a strong background in geospatial analysis and a keen eye for detail, I love exploring the intersection of spatial data and environmental science. I believe that by understanding the intricate relationships between land, water, and climate, we can make informed decisions to foster a more sustainable future.

Through my GitHub projects, you'll find a collection of innovative tools, scripts, and visualizations aimed at unlocking the potential of geospatial data. I'm particularly focused on developing solutions for water resource management, as well as leveraging data analysis techniques to inform sustainable practices.

I'm always excited to collaborate and learn from fellow data enthusiasts and environmentalists. So, if you're interested in geospatial data, water resources, or sustainability, feel free to connect and let's make a positive impact together! 🌱💧
