Hi, I’m @noportman

I'm a passionate data analyst with a strong focus on sustainability, geospatial insights, and data-driven decision-making. Currently, I'm enrolled in the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Data Science and Analytics, where I am honing my skills in statistical modeling, machine learning, and big data analysis to drive impactful solutions. 📊🌍

With a background in geospatial analysis and environmental engineering, I enjoy exploring the intersection of data science, sustainability, and water resource management. I believe that leveraging data-driven insights can help inform more sustainable practices and improve our understanding of environmental systems.

Through my GitHub projects, you'll find a collection of tools, scripts, and visualizations that showcase my work in data analytics, geospatial modeling, and sustainability-focused insights. Whether it's working with large datasets, building predictive models, or visualizing spatial patterns, I strive to create solutions that make a measurable impact.

I'm always eager to collaborate and exchange ideas with fellow data scientists, engineers, and sustainability advocates. If you're interested in geospatial data, water resources, or sustainability analytics, let's connect and build something meaningful together! 🌱💡
